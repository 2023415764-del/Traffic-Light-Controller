These will be numeric inputs.\n2.  **Implement Fuzzy Logic (Placeholder):** For the first version, implement a placeholder fuzzy logic calculation. This could be a simple formula or a lookup table that maps sensor inputs to traffic light duration. The actual fuzzy logic implementation can be refined later.\n3.  **Display Traffic Light Duration:** Display the calculated traffic light duration on the home screen.\n4.  **Visualize Traffic Light State:** Add a visual representation of the traffic light (a circle that changes color to red, yellow, or green) based on the calculated duration.\n5.  **Button:** Add a button that triggers the calculation.\n\nNow, let's instruct the coding agent to implement the plan.\n\nOkay, I have a plan for the coding agent.\n\n1.  Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:\n    *   Add two `TextInput` components for \"Car Density\" and \"Pedestrian Count\".\n    *   Add a \"Calculate\" `Button` component.\n    *   Add a `Text` component to display the calculated traffic light duration.\n    *   Add a `View` component with a circular shape and background color that changes based on the calculated duration (red, yellow, green).\n    *   Implement a placeholder fuzzy logic calculation within the `onPress` handler of the \"Calculate\" button. This placeholder should take the input values, perform a simple calculation (e.g., `duration = carDensity + pedestrianCount`), and update the displayed duration and traffic light color.\n2.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, I will be ready for the next steps.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T14:03:20.503718"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a fuzzy traffic light controller app. Let me start by searching for relevant information and understanding the current project structure."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Let me read the current project structure to understand what we're working with:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "constants/Colors.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I need to update the colors in commonStyles.ts to match the specified color scheme and create the fuzzy traffic light controller.
